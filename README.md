# DevOps Project - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery of Vprofile Project on AWS Cloud

This is a DevOps project for [CI/CD](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd) (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) of vprofile project on [AWS Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/) using [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/), [AWS CodeArtifact](https://aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/), [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/), [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html), [SonarCloud](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/), [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/), [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) etc. This project is a continuation of [_vprofile-project-ci-aws_](https://github.com/durrezahmed/vprofile-project-ci-aws) project.

## Problem - Issues with Current Situation:

- In an Agile SDLC, there will be Frequent Code Changes

- Manual Code Deployment is Time Consuming

- Developer and Testers not equipped with Ops Knowledge

- Need to Hire Ops Professionals

- Or Outsource

- Dependency on Ops Team

- CI/CD Server Maintenance

- Operational Overhead to Maintain Servers like Jenkins, Nexus, Sonar, Git, QA Server for Testing

## Solution - Fix:

- PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) Cloud Services

- Disposable Environment

- Automate Cl/CD Process

- Build, Test, Deploy and Test for Every Commit

## Benefits - CI/CD Pipeline on Cloud:

- Short MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery)

- No Human Intervention

- Fault Isolation

- Agile

- No Ops
